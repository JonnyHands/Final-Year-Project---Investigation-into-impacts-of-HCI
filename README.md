# Final Year Project - Investigation into impacts of HCI
 Year 21/22. An investigation into the impact Human-Computer Interaction has on user experience of video games and subsequent development of related game .
 
 
The objective of this project and report was to delve into Human-Computer interaction (HCI) of video games and distinguish what makes good examples of HCI in video games and why. This was done with extensive research to find and obtain good and bad examples of HCI in video games. These were then designed, implemented, and evaluated into a video game made with Unity that will run on the windows 10 operating system. The video game made has differing variants of itself, one with good HCI and one with bad HCI and through user testing and user feedback evidence was gathered to support findings.
